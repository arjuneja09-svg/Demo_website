### Email #2: Follow-Up Email (3-4 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about [Hotel Name]'s website

```
Hi [Hotel Manager Name],

I wanted to follow up on my message from earlier this week about helping 
[Hotel Name] increase direct bookings through a new website.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**The Problem:**
Many boutique hotels lose 15-30% of their revenue to OTA commissions when 
they could be capturing those bookings directly.

**The Solution:**
A modern, conversion-optimized website that makes booking directly easier 
and more appealing than using third-party sites.

**Real Results:**
Our South Florida hotel clients typically see ROI within 3-6 months through 
increased direct bookings alone.

I'd love to share our **Azure Palm Resort showcase** with you (it takes 
just 5 minutes to review) and discuss three pricing tiers we offer:

1. Starter Package: $2,997 (one-time)
2. Growth Package: $4,997 (one-time)
3. Premium Package: $7,997 (one-time)

All packages include mobile design, booking system, and SEO optimization.

Can we schedule a quick 10-minute call this week?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Kanik Web Studio
